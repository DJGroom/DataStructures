### Assignment
<p>
Deliver a working Template Class for the Stack Data Structure.
</p>
<p>
You must give proper acknowledgement of your sources and
demonstrate an understanding of any code that you reuse by adding appropriate comments.
</p>

### Requirements
<p>
Your implementation must successfully pass all the automated tests in the test-main.cpp file
provided as part of the scaffolding.  You may not change any of the test cases themselves.
</p>
<p>
You may temporarily comment out, or #if #endif out, some automated tests as you begin your implementation.
Then put the tests back in as you build out your solution to be more and more complete.
</p>
<p>
Your implementation must compile, run, and pass all the automated regression tests, and terminate normally.
</p>

### Grading Rubric

| Grade      | Criteria |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Zero       | no work submitted |
| D-         | work does not demonstrate sufficient effort |
| B          | Test program compiles, runs, passes most of the test cases, and terminates normally. |
| A          | Code is well commented and demonstrates an understanding of the implementation. |

### Submitting Your Work
Submit a well structured project folder that is structured and organized exactly as shown below. This should match what we have done for previous project homework.
```
StackTemplateClass
    appl
        main-test.cpp
    lib
        Stack.hpp
    Makefile
```

- Compress the content of this folder into a single .zip file.
- You must "make clean" the project before you compress it.
- Your zip file must be named:
```
    CS231-HW07-StackTemplate-Yourlastname.zip
```
